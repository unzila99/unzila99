    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach. One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "Example: Parrot is an object, • name, age, color are attributes • singing, dancing are behavior The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)."

    "List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of OOP are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tOOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIt is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tImplementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIt is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tobjects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tEncapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIt implements real life scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIn OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures."
